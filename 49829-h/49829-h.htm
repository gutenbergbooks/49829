<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Fifty million years ago the southwestern corner of
what is now Wyoming was part of a system of three freshwater
lakes that covered that area plus adjacent parts of
Colorado and Utah.</p>
<p>These lakes began with Lake Flagstaff and later became
Lake Gosiute, Lake Uinta, and Fossil Lake (<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>).
These lakes developed in intermontane basins that were
created as a result of the geologic events that formed the
Rocky Mountains. The three lakes, collectively known
as the Green River Lake System, had a long, complex
history of expansion and contraction. Varying climatic
and geologic conditions were responsible for the changes
in lake size and distribution.</p>
<p>The shores surrounding the lakes were blanketed by a
lush, green canopy of palm, cinnamon, maple, oak, and
other familiar trees. Hazel and lilac covered the forest
floor. Rushes and other aquatic plants lined the lake
shore.</p>
<p>The air was humid and warm. Streams flowing down
from the hills and mountains built up flood plains and fed
sediment into the lake, where it was deposited in shallow
water near the shore. Deposits formed by chemical processes
settled to the bottom further from shore in deep,
quiet water. From these processes were formed the rocks
from which the past history of Green River Lake System
is read.</p>
<p>In the forest and undergrowth lived the ancestors of
modern mammal groups. Ancestral rodents and tiny
insectivores lived a furtive existence in the brush and
mold that carpeted the forest floor, or else they sought a
livelihood among the branches of trees. Large, bizarre
animals with strange names lumbered through the reed-covered
streamsides eating soft, succulent plants. The
earliest members of the horse family browsed on the soft
vegetation. The trees overhead were alive with the chattering
and antics of early primates. Carnivorous mammals
preyed on their plant-eating neighbors and so maintained
a balanced community. Crocodiles and turtles basked in
the sun on the beach. Flamingos concentrated in large
nesting grounds. Snakes and lizards crawled about in the
undergrowth. Insects, many exceedingly similar to
modern types, flew about in the warm air or crept about
on the plants.</p>
<p>The waters of the lakes teemed with many types of fish.
Relatives of the perch, herring, and sting ray swam in the
warm lake water. Occasionally, large-scale mortalities of
the fish occurred. As the fish died, they sank to the bottom
of the lake, and were preserved in the lake sediments.</p>
<p>Today, the lakes are gone and where once there were
lush tropical forests there is now a semi-desert covered
with sagebrush and greasewood. The history of these
lakes, forests, and animal life can be read in the thick
sediments deposited so long ago.</p>
<p>This report concerns itself with one of these lakes, the
smallest of the three, Fossil Lake. Famous for its fossil
fish beds, part of this ancient lake is now Fossil Butte
National Monument. It is the purpose of this report to
relate the history of Fossil Lake and its now fossilized
inhabitants, thereby, hopefully presenting the order of
events in a landscape obscured by 50 million years of
time.</p>
<h2 id="c2">LOCATION</h2>
<p>Fossil Butte National Monument is near the geographical
center of Fossil Basin. The basin itself is located in the
extreme southwestern part of Wyoming in Uinta and
Lincoln counties, near the Utah-Idaho border (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>The monument is situated about 10 miles west of
Kemmerer, Lincoln County, Wyoming (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>). U.S.
Highway 30N runs just south of the monument as does
the Union Pacific Railroad line to Oregon. The abandoned
town of Fossil is also immediately south of the monument.</p>
<p>The Kemmerer and Sage quadrangles of the United
States Geological Survey cover the entire monument and
the surrounding area.</p>
<h2 id="c3">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH</h2>
<p>The principal rocks involved at Fossil Butte are the
Green River and Wasatch formations. The first published
notice of these two rock units was by Hayden (1869).
Although short, Hayden&rsquo;s descriptions were the basis for
later refinement of the stratigraphy of the Green River and
Fossil basins. Hayden also mentioned the quantities of
fossil fish from the Green River Formation.</p>
<p>The work done by Hayden was conducted under the
auspices of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological
and Geographical Survey of the Territories. The
survey lasted from 1867 to 1878, during which time
Hayden and his associates published annual reports of
their findings.</p>
<p>In the 1870 report, Hayden (1871) mentioned the
discovery of the Petrified Fish Cut. This cut is located
on the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad about 2
miles west of Green River, Wyoming. A. W. Hilliard and
L. E. Rickseeker, employees of the Union Pacific Railroad,
discovered the cut and obtained many fossil fish
which they turned over to Hayden.</p>
<p>Previous to Hayden, rocks now known as the Green
River and Wasatch formations were occasionally mentioned
in the various diaries, journals, and reports of early
missionaries like those of S. A. Parker or those of explorers
like Fremont (Knight 1955).</p>

<p>Hayden&rsquo;s report (1871:425-437) included a description
of the fish fossils from Petrified Fish Cut by E. D.
Cope, a vertebrate paleontologist. Several years earlier
Leidy (1856), another paleontologist, described a fish
from an unknown locality in the Green River Formation.</p>
<p>Hayden divided this survey area into several districts.
The Green River district was put in charge of A. C.
Peale. Peale&rsquo;s (1879:535) report contained the first
geologic description of Fossil Butte itself, as well as a
short discussion of the fish fossils obtained there. The
description of the butte is quoted here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... In the lower part of the bluff from which these specimens
are taken, the bright coloured beds of the Wasatch
are seen outcropping, although the entire section cannot
be seen, as their softness causes them to weather so that
the debris conceals the strata. The fossils are found at
several horizons in the shales. Near the top of the bluff
is a band of hard, bituminous, or oily shale, which burns
rather freely with a strong bituminous odor.... It is
brownish-black in color and on the weathered surfaces
a bluish white....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next major publication dealing with Fossil Basin
was that by Veatch (1907). He mapped the rocks in
certain areas of the basin in an attempt to bring a semblance
of order to Hayden&rsquo;s (1869) broad stratigraphic
descriptions. His work resulted in the designation of
most of the rock units in Fossil Basin from Jurassic to
Recent.</p>
<p>Schultz (1914), an associate of Veatch, published a
paper dealing with the structures to the north and east of
Fossil Basin. This helped to delineate the features surrounding
and forming the basin.</p>
<p>Subsequent work on the geology of southwest Wyoming
mainly has been concentrated on the Green River
Basin just east of Fossil Basin. Significant work on Fossil
Basin has been done by Rubey et al. (1968a, b) who
mapped the northern part of the basin, and by Oriel and
Tracey (1970) who have published results of the latest
study on the stratigraphy and age of the rock units in
Fossil Basin. This latest work is the culmination of many
years of study and incorporates and refines data presented
in shorter, earlier papers.</p>
<h2 id="c4">STRATIGRAPHY</h2>
<p>The complete geologic history of the Fossil Basin
involves many stratigraphic units. Most of these are not
exposed within the monument itself but are well known
from outcrops outside the boundaries of the monument
and from deep wells (<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>
<p>At the base of the stratigraphic section are rocks of
Precambrian age. These have not been penetrated by
wells within the Fossil Basin but should occur as much as
25,000 ft beneath the surface. They probably consist of
metamorphic and intrusive rocks. Beginning about 600
million years ago, at the beginning of Cambrian time,
sedimentary deposits accumulated. These are both marine
and continental in origin and range in age from early
Cambrian (600 million years old) to early Tertiary (50
million years old). Some 34 geologic formations are
recognized in this thick section, a list of which follows:</p>

</table>
<p>Within the monument itself the oldest rocks exposed
are those of the Thaynes Limestone near Prow Point. As
will be seen in the discussion of the structure of the Fossil
Basin, all of the rocks beneath the Evanston Formation
are folded and faulted and within the monument are buried
by deposits of Tertiary age. For this reason detailed discussion
of stratigraphic units will be confined to those
rocks that can be seen within the boundaries of the monument
or closely adjacent to it (<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). The distribution
of the various formations within the monument is illustrated
in Figs. <a href="#fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#fig_8">8</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c5">Thaynes Limestone</h3>
<p>At the very northeastern corner of Fossil Butte National
Monument can be seen an outcrop of the Thaynes Limestone
of Triassic age, a marine unit deposited some 200
million years ago. This formation is noted for its rich and
varied assemblage of marine fossils, mostly forms related
to oysters and clams. The Thaynes Limestone consists
predominantly of sandy, gray limestone and green-gray
limey siltstones. The formation weathers to a dark brown
in the lower part and a grayish-yellow in the upper. The
fact that the Thaynes Limestone is exposed in the monument
at all is because of the faulting that took place just
prior to the deposition of the Evanston Formation of latest
Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary age (refer to section on
structure) and the erosion of the Tertiary rocks that once
covered it.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Evanston Formation</h3>
<p>Although not seen within the boundaries of the Fossil
Butte National Monument, the Evanston Formation is
exposed just south of Highway 30N, 1.5 miles southeast
of the southeast corner of the monument. The Evanston
was not involved in the complex folding and faulting but
it is somewhat disturbed and rests under the Wasatch
Formation with angular uncomformity. The Evanston
Formation bridges the time boundary between the Cretaceous
and Tertiary periods. In the lower part of the unit
are found many fossil leaves, pollen, and spores and a
jaw of the horned dinosaur <i>Triceratops</i> that prove its
Cretaceous age, and in the upper part are found fossil
mammals of Paleocene age.</p>
<p>The Evanston Formation has been studied in detail by
Oriel and Tracey (1970). These authors divide the formation
into three members. The lowest, which they called
the Lower Member, is predominantly &ldquo;gray to very dark
gray mudstone, siltstone, claystone and gray carbonaceous
sandstone.&rdquo; The Lower Member reaches a thickness
of 500 ft in some places. Above and in part interfingering
with the Lower Member is a 1000 ft thick unit
that was named the Hams Fork Conglomerate Member.
This unit consists of beds of boulder conglomerate
interstratified with thick beds of coarse, partly conglomeratic
brown sandstone and gray mudstone. Where
the Lower Member of the Evanston is missing, the Hams
Fork Conglomerate forms the base of the formation.</p>
<p>The Upper Member of the Evanston Formation is
termed by Oriel and Tracey (1970) the Main Body. It is
more than a thousand feet thick and the lower part intertongues
with the Hams Fork Conglomerate. The Main
Body is &ldquo;light to dark gray carbonaceous sandy to clayey
siltstone interbedded with gray, tan, yellow and brown
sandstone and conglomerate and carbonaceous to lignitic
claystone.&rdquo; It is this Main Body that can be seen along
the highway just southeast of the monument.</p>
<p>The types of sediments and fossils found in the
Evanston indicate that the formation was deposited by
streams on flood plains and in marshes and ponds. A
subtropical climate is indicated and the area was heavily
wooded.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Wasatch Formation</h3>
<p>The term Wasatch was first used by Hayden (1869:91)
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Immediately west of Fort Bridger commences one of the
most remarkable and extensive groups of Tertiary beds
seen in the West. They are wonderfully variegated, some
shade of red predominating. This group, to which I have
given the name of Wasatch group, is composed of variegated
sands and clays. Very little calcareous matter is
found in these beds.</p>
<p>In Echo and Weber Canyons are wonderful displays
of conglomerates, fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in
thickness. Although this group occupies a vast area, and
attains a thickness of three to five thousand feet, yet I have
never known any remains of animals to be found in it. I
regard it, however, as of middle Tertiary age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wasatch is well exposed in Fossil Basin. There the
unit was regarded by Veatch (1907) as a group and
divided by him into three formations: the Almy, Fowkes,
and Knight. He wrote (1907:88):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Wasatch group as thus defined by Hayden the
field work of the season 1905 showed three divisions: 1) a
basal member composed of reddish-yellow sandy clays,
in many places containing pronounced conglomerate beds,
which has been named the Almy Formation; 2) a great
thickness of light-colored rhyolitic ash beds containing
intercalated lenses of white limestones with fresh-water
shells and leaves&mdash;the Fowkes Formation; and 3) a group
of reddish-yellow sandy clays with irregular sandstone
beds (the Knight Formation) closely resembling 1) lithologically
and separated from 1) &amp; 2) by a pronounced
period of folding and erosion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veatch, however, erred in his field work and did not
realize that the Fowkes Formation had been downfaulted
into the position in which he saw it (Tracey and Oriel
1959; Eardley 1959). The Fowkes is actually the youngest
of the three formations of Veatch and is considerably
later in age than the true Wasatch.</p>
<p>The Almy and Knight formations are not separable
(Oriel and Tracey 1970:16), and can be seen to grade into
each other at the basin edges.</p>

</div>
<p>The Almy and Knight, as defined by Veatch, are probably
different facies of Wasatch, the Almy being a more
peripheral facies and the Knight a more basinal facies
(Oriel and Tracey 1970). These authors proposed that the
terms Almy and Knight be dropped and that the name
Wasatch be applied to all these rocks to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The latest subdivision of the Wasatch Formation in the
Fossil Basin is that of Oriel and Tracey. The members of
the Wasatch Formation they propose are described in
order from oldest to youngest.</p>
<h4 id="c8">BASAL CONGLOMERATE MEMBER.</h4>
<p>This member
has only local development in Fossil Basin. Where
found, it is a lenticular conglomerate with pebbles and
cobbles of buff and tan sandstone from the Nugget Sandstone
and limestone fragments from the Thaynes and
Twin Creek formations.</p>
<p>The basal conglomerate is essentially a channel fill in
ancient stream beds cut into Mesozoic rocks.</p>
<h4 id="c9">LOWER MEMBER.</h4>
<p>This is an irregular sequence of
flood-plain and stream-channel deposits. It is exposed
along the southern part of the Tunp Range and extends
into the far western section of Fossil Butte National
Monument just below Prow Point.</p>
<p>Mudstone is the main rock type. It can be tan, brown,
pink, red, or gray in color. Black, carbonaceous siltstones
are also present. Gray sandstone that weathers yellow or
brown and coarse-grained, cross-bedded conglomerate
and sandstone are also prominent. Limestone occurs as
thin lenses and is often brown, platy, and carbonaceous.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the Lower Member is
intermediate not only in stratigraphic position but also in
color and composition between the underlying Evanston
Formation and overlying Main Body of the Wasatch
Formation. The Lower Member thus appears to represent
a gradual change in either climatic and/or sedimentary
conditions in Fossil Basin (Oriel and Tracey 1970).</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c10">MAIN BODY.</h4>
<p>This unit of the Wasatch Formation is
that part of the formation which produces the spectacular
red-colored badlands in Fossil Butte National Monument.
Particularly typical exposures can be seen in the south-facing
scarp of Fossil Butte where the Main Body makes
up the lower portion of the butte.</p>
<p>The most remarkable feature of the Main Body is its
color. On the lower slopes of Fossil Butte are bands of
bright to dull red, pink, purple, yellow, and gray color
arranged in various patterns. This unit is best observed
at a distance, especially after a rain. The bright hues of
the Wasatch contrast markedly with the whites and tans
of the overlying Green River Formation.</p>
<p>Individual bands of color range from 1 to 10 ft thick
(Oriel and Tracey 1970:78). The colors are brightest in
the upper part of the member and drabber in the coarser-grained
lower part.</p>
<p>The predominant rock types in the Main Body are
banded, variegated mudstone with interlayered sandstone,
conglomerate, marlstone, siltstone, and claystone.</p>
<p>The upper part of the Main Body is mainly mudstone
composed of fine silt and very fine, bedded sand with a
clay binder. Conglomerates occur as channel fills and
contain calcium carbonate as cement as do a number of
sandstone and siltstone layers in the upper Main Body.</p>
<p>Conglomerates and sandstone are more common in the
lower part of the Main Body. Some are part of Veatch&rsquo;s
old Almy Formation. They are best developed along the
edge of Fossil Basin. The Main Body overlaps the
Evanston Formation in some places and may rest directly
on Mesozoic or Paleozoic rocks.</p>
<h4 id="c11">SANDSTONE TONGUE.</h4>
<p>This is a tongue of cross-bedded
sandstone. It is brown in color and is composed
mostly of quartz with some black chert grains. This unit
is limited in distribution to the south of Fossil Butte
National Monument. The Sandstone Tongue thins and
pinches out to the north and is not present within the
monument. The area of pinchout represents the shoreline
at one stage of Fossil Lake. The Sandstone Tongue
wedges into the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River
Formation. The sediment sources were probably the Uinta
Mountains at the south edge of Fossil Basin. Tectonic
events caused an uplift and erosion of Mesozoic and
Paleozoic rocks in the Uintas and debris was deposited in
Fossil Lake as an encroaching delta of sand. When
deposition of the sand halted, the lake expanded and
covered the sand, encasing it within the shales of the
Green River Formation.</p>
<p>The Sandstone Tongue can be traced into the Main
Body of the Wasatch, hence its assignment to the Wasatch
Formation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h4 id="c12">MUDSTONE TONGUE.</h4>
<p>This tongue of the Wasatch
Formation can be seen in the northwestern part of Fossil
Butte National Monument and over most of the northern
part of Fossil Basin. In the area of its distribution, the
Mudstone Tongue separates the underlying Fossil Butte
Member of the Green River Formation from the overlying
Angelo Member of the Green River Formation. The
tongue thins and disappears to the south, that is, basinward.
As with the Sandstone Tongue, the edges of the
Mudstone Tongue where it pinches out represent an
ancient shoreline of Fossil Lake. To the north and west
the Mudstone Tongue merges with the Tunp Member of
the Wasatch Formation.</p>
<p>The Mudstone Tongue is a composite of dark-red
mudstone which becomes lighter in color basinward,
changing to light red, pink, or greenish-gray claystone.
The unit is a mixture of silt and clay derived from the
north and west, and was deposited as a large delta in
Fossil Lake.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of the Mudstone Tongue is the
presence of algal logs. These are cylinders of limestone
that apparently formed as an encrustation of calcium
carbonate around logs and branches that fell into the edge
of the lake. The calcium carbonate resulted from the
action of algae which grew around the log. Successive
growths of algae resulted in successive layers of calcium
carbonate being deposited.</p>
<h4 id="c13">BULLPEN MEMBER.</h4>
<p>This uppermost member of
the Wasatch Formation is found mostly to the west and
south of the monument. A few, small, isolated caps on the
top of the Green River Formation east of Prow Point
occur within the monument. These low hills, mere bumps,
are remnants of a once more extensive distribution of the
Bullpen Member.</p>
<p>Veatch (1907:99) originally considered what is now
called the Bullpen Member as being the Bridger Formation,
this was based mostly on the Bullpen&rsquo;s position
above the Green River Formation rather than on any
lithologic resemblance to the Bridger. The Bullpen is
much redder in color than the Bridger.</p>
<p>In early work Tracey and Oriel (1959:729) called these
beds an upper tongue of the Wasatch and have since
named them the Bullpen Member.</p>
<p>The Bullpen Member is lithologically very like the
Main Body of the Wasatch and can be traced into the
peripheral units of the Wasatch Formation.</p>
<p>The rocks included within the Bullpen Member are
layered sequences of red, pink, gray, and green claystone
and mudstone. Bentonite is present in some claystone
beds and causes sloughing because of its property of
expanding when wet. Some sandstones are present in the
northern areas of the member&rsquo;s distribution. Limestones
are also present. They are thin and slabby and have a
brown, white, or gray color. Some contain varying
amounts of clay. A conglomerate is present in the upper
part of the Bullpen toward the basin periphery and merges
with the Tunp Member of the Wasatch Formation.</p>
<p>The Bullpen Member is conformable with the underlying
Angelo Member of the Green River Formation. The
contact is a transitional one reflecting a gradual change
from the lake environment of the Green River Formation
through a swamp environment to that of a flood plain. The
light-colored, fine-grained shales, marlstones, and limestones
of the Green River Formation grade upward into
drabber, coarser grained clay and mudstones of the Bullpen
Member as a reflection of this change of environments.</p>
<h4 id="c14">TUNP MEMBER.</h4>
<p>This peripheral unit of the Wasatch
Formation was first described by Oriel and Tracey in
1970. It is not exposed in the monument, but forms a belt
of outcrops around the edge of Fossil Basin and in channels
cut at right angles to the basin edge.</p>
<p>The Tunp Member is seen to intertongue with nearly
all of the Wasatch and Green River formations. The
member grades laterally basinward from coarse, angular
conglomerates to fine mudstone. Two limestone tongues
of the Green River Formation are interbedded with the
Tunp, indicating that at least twice there was major expansion
of the lake.</p>
<p>Lithologically, the Tunp Member is a diamictite. This
is a sedimentary rock with a wide range of particle sizes.
The Tunp is best described as a red, conglomeratic,
sandy mudstone with angular, poorly rounded to smooth,
well-rounded clasts with a size range from pebble to
boulder. There is no bedding or orientation of clasts.</p>
<p>The Tunp Member probably originated from mudflows
and gravity sliding (Tracey et al. 1961). Environmental
studies indicate that the area had a warm, humid climate.
This would cause deep weathering of the surrounding
slopes. This weathered material would then be a prime
source to be acted upon by rain, gravity, and possibly
earthquakes. These agents of deposition would then
cause the material to flow and be deposited with little
chance for sorting and rounding of the rock particles. The
result was a belt of coarse, unsorted detritus on the basin
edges now called the Tunp Member.</p>
<h4 id="c15">AGE OF THE WASATCH FORMATION.</h4>
<p>The exact age of the units within the Wasatch Formation can be
determined only if fossils are present. None has been
found in the basal conglomerates but it is believed to be
earliest Eocene. The Lower Member is also not dated
with fossils but is believed to be very early Eocene. A
number of fossil mammals are known from the Main
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Body of the Wasatch Formation. The lower part is early,
early Eocene as demonstrated by the presence of a very
primitive ungulate, <i>Haplomylus speirianus</i>. In the upper
part of the Main Body another primitive ungulate,
<i>Hyopsodus browni</i>, is found which indicates a mid to
early Eocene age. The Mudstone and Sandstone tongues
are not dated by means of fossils but the stratigraphic
relationships indicate an early Eocene age. Fossil mollusks
in the Bullpen Member are not completely diagnostic
but suggest either a late early Eocene (Lostcabinian)
(<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) or mid-Eocene age. The Tunp Member
interfingering as it does with the entire Wasatch section
represents all of early Eocene age.</p>
<h4 id="c16">DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.</h4>
<p>The sediments that make up the Wasatch Formation in the Fossil Basin
were deposited mainly by streams flowing into the basin
from the surrounding uplands. Rock types are variable
and for the most part individual types cannot be traced
over large areas, a condition typical of fluvial environments.
The mudstones and siltstones probably were deposited
along flood plains, while the lenticular sands and
conglomerates were laid down in stream channels. Where
streams entered the lake tongues of deltaic deposits,
sands or mudstones wedge into the Green River Lake
sediments.</p>
<p>The reason for the red color of the Wasatch Formation
is not fully known. According to Van Houten (1948), the
red is most likely the result of tropical, red lateritic soils
forming in the uplands and being deposited on flood
plains. The oxidation of organic material in a humid,
subtropical environment causes the red color. The bands
of purple, gray, orange, and other colors are due to
various stages in the reduction of the iron oxides in the
rocks.</p>
<p>The presence of palms in the lake sediments and of
bones of primates and crocodiles in both the lacustrine
and fluvial sediments indicate a heavily forested, tropical
environment.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Green River Formation</h3>
<p>The Green River Formation is easily recognized by its
light color and continuous bedding, in strong contrast to
the red, discontinuous, variegated Wasatch Formation
below. The Green River Formation can be thought of as a
gigantic lens of lacustrine sediments enclosed in the
fluvial Wasatch Formation. The name Green River
Formation is applied to all of the roughly contemporaneous
deposits laid down in lakes of Utah, Colorado, and
Wyoming. It is probable that at one time or another all of
these lakes were connected.</p>
<p>Oriel and Tracey (1970) have divided the Green River
Formation of the Fossil Basin into two members: the
Fossil Butte Member and the Angelo Member.</p>
<h4 id="c18">FOSSIL BUTTE MEMBER.</h4>
<p>The type section for this
member is near the southeastern end of Fossil Butte
within the monument boundaries. In the type area the
Fossil Butte Member can be seen to consist of four
lithologic units.</p>
<p>The lowermost unit is predominantly mudstone. It
occurs in a sequence about 45 ft thick and contains light
gray, fine-grained, calcareous mudstone and siltstone.</p>
<p>The next overlying unit is about 75 ft thick and is
mainly a limestone unit. It consists of tan to gray limestone,
shaly limestone, siltstone, and paper shale which
weathers into thin, curled flakes. A yellow-brown mudstone
tops this unit.</p>
<p>The third unit in the sequence is 45 ft thick and mainly
composed of shales. These shales weather a buff color
and are calcareous. Oil shale, organic rich paper shale,
and marlstone comprise the actual layers in the unit. A
few, thin ash beds are also present. This unit is the most
significant one for Fossil Butte National Monument.
About 10 ft below the top of this unit (about 155 ft above
the Wasatch) is a bed of varved shales, one foot thick,
that contains the fossil fish for which the monument was
established.</p>
<p>The uppermost unit contains a number of beds of oil
shale that are brown on a fresh surface but weather a
grayish-white. An orange-yellow-weathering limestone
caps the 40-ft thick upper unit. Ash beds are common
and traceable over a wide area of Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>South of the monument the Sandstone Tongue of the
Wasatch Formation wedges in between the lowermost
unit and the overlying limestone unit of the Fossil Butte
Member.</p>
<p>In the Fossil Butte Member an interesting sequence of
facies changes can be seen which reflect lateral changes
in the environment of Fossil Lake. In those areas where
the member represents a deep-water environment, organically
formed limestones and shales are predominant.
Shoreward, these rocks grade into ostracodal limestone,
gastrapodal limestone, and, closest to shore, algal limestone.
Then a muddy, sandy beach facies is encountered
where the Green River and Wasatch formations intergrade.</p>
<p>The contact with the underlying Wasatch is conformable
and sharp. It is often marked by a bench or by slump
blocks of Green River Formation.</p>
<p>The Fossil Butte Member may in some cases overlap
the Wasatch Formation and be deposited on Paleozoic
and Mesozoic rocks. This is a reflection of topographic
relief during the Eocene.</p>
<p>The thickness of the Fossil Butte Member, as reported
by Oriel and Tracey (1970:37), is from 208 to 269 ft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h4 id="c19">ANGELO MEMBER.</h4>
<p>In the northern part of Fossil
Basin, the Mudstone Tongue of the Wasatch Formation
separates the Angelo Member of the Green River Formation
from the Fossil Butte Member. Further south, the two
members rest directly on one another. The southern extent
of the Angelo Member has not been determined as yet,
but Oriel and Tracey (1970:32) believe it extends up
to, and intertongues with, Wasatch conglomerates near
the Uinta Mountains. Toward other edges of Fossil Basin,
the Angelo Member thins and pinches out into the
Wasatch Formation. The Bullpen Member of the Wasatch
rests on top of the Angelo Member.</p>
<p>The Angelo Member consists of white to blue-white
weathering limestone, marlstone, and mudstone. Some
sandstone lenses, claystone, oil shale, and siliceous
limestone are present as well. In general, Oriel and Tracey
(1970) have found that buff limestones prevail to the north
and white, siliceous limestone, to the south. Like the
Fossil Butte Member, the Angelo Member shows a facies
change from deep-water to shore.</p>
<p>This member forms the very uppermost, rounded
slopes of Fossil Butte in contrast to the more vertical cliffs
formed by the Fossil Butte Member.</p>
<h4 id="c20">AGE OF THE GREEN RIVER FORMATION.</h4>
<p>The age of the Green River Formation is dated on its intertonguing
relationships with the Wasatch Formation
because the latter has datable mammal fossils. The well-preserved
fossils of fish, leaves, and insects from the
Green River are, unfortunately, of little value in dating
the Green River Formation.</p>
<p>Although no Lostcabinian mammals are known from
Fossil Basin, the Green River Formation is believed to be
of that age (Gazin 1959; Schaeffer and Mangus 1965).</p>
<h4 id="c21">DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.</h4>
<p>The Green River Formation, on the basis of its lithology and fossil content,
is a fresh-water, lacustrine deposit. Clay and silt were
dumped in Fossil Lake by streams. Most of this fine debris
was deposited near the shore. Chemical and organic processes
formed limestones and marlstones in the deeper
central part of the lake.</p>
<p>Examination of the edge of the Green River Formation
indicates that Fossil Lake expanded and contracted several
times.</p>
<p>Fossil Lake was eventually filled in with chemical
precipitates and deltaic deposits. The end of the lake was
gradual as seen in the transitional and gradational Green
River-Bullpen contact.</p>
<p>Although oil shale is not extensively developed in the
Green River Formation of Fossil Basin, it does occur in
small quantities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock containing
organic matter which was derived chiefly from aquatic
organisms, waxy spores and pollen grains ... and of
which a large portion is distillable into a liquid similar to
petroleum. Despite the name, most rich beds of oil shale in
the Green River Formation cannot be regarded strictly as
shale. Instead, they are dolomitic marlstones rich in organic
matter. Nevertheless, a few are shaly (Bradley
1964b:19).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oil shale has a structureless ground mass that is
yellowish-orange to reddish-orange in color. Pyrite crystals
are found indicating a partially anaerobic or reducing
environment. Pollen, waxy spores, filaments of algae,
and other plant parts are preserved along with insects and
larvae. The preservation is akin to mummification.
Crystals of calcite, dolomite, or authigenic feldspar are
also found in the oil shale (Bradley 1966).</p>
<p>The exact mode of origin of oil shale is not positively
known because of a lack of a modern analogue for comparison.
Oil shale probably originated as an organic ooze
on the bottom of the Fossil Lake. This ooze was composed
of the remains of phytoplankton, blue-green algae,
zooplankton, bacteria, and some pollen and spores. The
ooze was dense and uncompacted. Little clastic debris is
found, either because the ooze accumulated in deep water
or plants near the shore filtered out the debris.</p>
<p>Decay was reduced effectively in the ooze because of
either an antibiotic in the ooze which inhibited bacteria of
decay or the ooze accumulated in waters where anaerobic
conditions prevented decay.</p>
<p>With time and the weight of overlying sediments, the
ooze was compacted and most of its water driven off.
Continuing pressure from compaction and heat generated
by burial and compaction caused a variety of complex
chemical reactions which converted the ooze into a
petroleum product called kerogen. Kerogen is distillable
and is the important constituent of oil shale.</p>
<p>An alternate hypothesis (Eugster and Surdam 1973),
would have some oil shale forming in a desert-playa
environment. This is based on geochemical evidence
found in Gosiute Lake sediments to the east of Fossil
Lake. There, certain minerals are found in association
with some oil shale that could only have been deposited
during periods of extreme evaporation and in a shallow
lake. Much study is now being directed toward a solution
to these problems.</p>
<p>The combustible quality of oil shale has been known
for a long time. Many of the pioneers used it as a fuel
for cooking and heat. Hayden (1871:142) wrote of how
workmen on the Union Pacific accidently ignited the oil
shale in a cut they were excavating. The burning shale
provided enough light for night work.</p>
<p>Many of the shales of the Green River Formation
appear to be varved. A varve consists of two layers, one
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of calcium or magnesium carbonate and one of organic
material. The limnological conditions that led to the
formation of varves will be discussed in their proper
place in the section on Paleoecology.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Fowkes Formation</h3>
<p>This is the middle formation of Veatch&rsquo;s (1907) tripartite
division of the Wasatch Group. It is now found to
be the youngest formation in Fossil Basin. It is not exposed
in Fossil Butte National Monument.</p>
<p>Oriel and Tracey (1970) have formally divided and
named three members of the Fowkes Formation: a lower
Sillem Member, a middle Bulldog Hollow Member, and
an upper Gooseberry Member.</p>
<h4 id="c23">SILLEM MEMBER.</h4>
<p>Like most of the Fowkes Formation,
this sequence of rocks has been eroded extensively
and is preserved as erosional remnants, where protected
by faulting, in the western part of Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>The Sillem Member consists of a lower conglomeratic
sequence with some sandstone and mudstone. The conglomerate
contains well-rounded clasts of gray quartzite,
chert, and Paleozoic limestone. The sandstone is light
gray, calcareous to muddy, and coarse to medium-grained.
The mudstone is pink, gray, or tan in color.</p>
<p>The upper part of the Sillem Member is a mudstone
and claystone unit. It ranges in color from pink and yellow
to gray and green. Some volcanic debris is found. There
are also interbedded layers of marlstone and limestone.
Some sandstone is present.</p>
<p>The Sillem Member is between 100 and 400 ft thick and
most probably rests unconformably on the Bullpen Member
of the Wasatch.</p>
<h4 id="c24">BULLDOG HOLLOW MEMBER.</h4>
<p>This middle member of the Fowkes Formation has the thickest and most
extensive outcrops. The Bulldog Hollow Member is exposed
along the west side of the basin.</p>
<p>Included rocks are green, white, and blue-green mudstone
with ash beds, green and buff claystone, and
tuffaceous, limy sandstone. A high percentage of the iron
mineral, magnetite, occurs in the sandstone. Conglomerate
occurs as lenses.</p>
<p>The Bulldog Hollow Member has a gradational contact
with the underlying Sillem Member. The amount of volcanic
material increases upward from the Sillem, indicating
an increase in volcanic activity during the deposition
of the Bulldog Hollow Member.</p>
<h4 id="c25">GOOSEBERRY MEMBER.</h4>
<p>Oriel and Tracey (1970:55)
place this uppermost member provisionally within the
Fowkes Formation. Most of the Gooseberry Member is a
puddingstone, a lithology with well-rounded, spherical
pebbles in a marlstone, sandstone, or sandy limestone
matrix. The pebbles are too rounded for the rock to be a
diamictite, and too separated from each other to be called
a conglomerate.</p>
<p>The nature of the Gooseberry-Bulldog Hollow contact
is not completely known. It appears to be gradational in
some areas and to be an angular unconformity in others.</p>
<h4 id="c26">AGE OF FOWKES FORMATION.</h4>
<p>Fossils date the
Sillem and Bulldog Hollow members as middle Eocene
in age. These fossils consist of ostracodes, gastropods,
leaves, and vertebrates from the Bulldog Hollow Member
(Nelson 1973). The Gooseberry Member has yielded a
few vertebrate remains and is late Miocene or early Pliocene
in age (Oriel and Tracey 1970).</p>
<h4 id="c27">DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.</h4>
<p>The Fowkes
Formation is an alluvial deposit, much like the Wasatch
Formation. The chemical and climatic conditions of
deposition were different from those of the Wasatch, and
the extensive red-beds are not developed.</p>
<p>Small lakes were present in which limestone and
marlstone accumulated. The puddingstone may be a mudflow.
Volcanic activity left its record in the ash found in
the Fowkes Formation.</p>
<p>In the past, the Fowkes Formation had a greater distribution.
Postdepositional faulting down dropped parts of
the Fowkes protecting them from subsequent erosion.</p>
<h2 id="c28">QUATERNARY</h2>
<p>Rubey et al. (1968a, b) have mapped several forms of
Quaternary deposits in Fossil Basin. These include stream
alluvium, rock and landslide debris, river terraces, and
gravels, all derived from local formations. These deposits
are the work of water, wind, and ice acting in relatively
Recent time.</p>
<h2 id="c29">THE GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL BASIN</h2>
<p>The Fossil Basin is a small, linear and structurally
controlled basin in the southeastern part of the Wyoming
overthrust belt. This &ldquo;overthrust belt&rdquo; is represented by a
number of small mountain ranges and high ridges formed
by the &ldquo;thrusting&rdquo; of sedimentary rocks over other sedimentary
rocks. Topographically, the Fossil Basin is
bounded by the Crawford Mountains and Tunp Range on
the west, by Oyster Ridge on the east, and by the Uinta
Mountains on the south. The Crawford Mountains,
Tunp Range, and Oyster Ridge (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) are areas of high
relief developed upon southerly extended salient ridges of
deformed Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata. In the center of
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the Fossil Basin, these earlier rocks are covered by a
veneer of early Tertiary sediments. Superficially, the
Fossil Basin appears to be a broad syncline with tilted
beds dipping sharply or gently basinward from the basin
margins. The Tertiary sedimentary cover, however, partially
obscures what is a more complex structural history.</p>
<p>Following deposition of the Late Cretaceous Adaville
Formation, the Fossil Basin was included in a period of
intense structural deformation. This deformation was the
result of compressional forces acting along a more or less
east-west alignment. The strain, or the resolution of these
forces, was developed along a north-south alignment or
perpendicular to the compressional forces. As the stress
level became too great, the rocks were first folded and
then faulted. Initial faulting of the rocks relieved some of
the stress; however, with continued application of compressive
forces many stages of folding and faulting were
generated. Because the alignment of the compressive
forces remained about the same throughout deformation
(i.e., east-west) and because the strongest relative compressive
forces were from the west, successively younger
folds and faults were generated in an eastward direction.</p>
<p>The structural evolution of the Fossil Butte area may be
interpreted as follows from the schematic diagrams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Rock Creek-Needles Anticline is developed at the
western edge of the Fossil Basin. The present topographic
highs developed on this structure are the
Crawford Mountains and Tunp Range (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>-B).</p>
<p>2. With continued application of compressional forces,
Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks to the east of the Rock
Creek-Needles Anticline are folded (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>-C).</p>
<p>3. The fold becomes sharply asymmetrical and when the
rocks can no longer accommodate the compressional
forces by further folding, a low-angle fault is developed
(Absaroka thrust fault). This fault probably
began as a fracture parallel to bedding which rose to
topographic surface at a low angle at the point of
greatest strain in the fold. Most likely, this fracture
was an eastward extension of the fault underlying
the Rock Creek-Needles Anticline, as depicted in
<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>-D.</p>
<p>4. The rocks to the west of the newly developed fault
overrode those to the east. This was accompanied by
further downwarping in the syncline to the east of the
fault and the erosion of uplifted sedimentary rocks on
the west side of the fault (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>-E).</p>
<p>5. Another cycle of folding and faulting was initiated to
the east of the Absaroka fault. This post-Absaroka
deformation instigated further downwarping of the
Fossil Basin area between the Tunp-Crawford Mountains
and Oyster Ridge. Tertiary sediments began to
accumulate in the Fossil Basin (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>-F).</p>

</div>
<p>In early Eocene times, the effects of continued downwarping
allowed Fossil Lake to form in the Fossil Basin.
By the late Eocene, however, basinal subsidence could no
longer keep pace with deposition and the dominantly
lacustrine (lake) sedimentation was replaced by a fluviatile
(riverine) sedimentary regime. Deposition of fluviatile
sediments probably continued into the later Tertiary
when, in the late Pliocene, regional uplift of the Rocky
Mountain interior reversed the sedimentary cycle from
depositional to erosional. The last 3 or 4 million years
of geologic history have witnessed the excavation of
much of the Tertiary sedimentary fill from the Fossil
Basin. Fossil Butte and the Ham&rsquo;s Fork Plateau to the
northeast of the butte are high erosional remnants of this
early Tertiary basin fill. The traces of the Absaroka and
other thrust faults are buried beneath these remaining
Tertiary deposits in the Fossil Basin.</p>
<p class="tb">While most of this complex structural history took
place before the Tertiary sediments were deposited, some
deformation continued into the early Eocene. Near Prow
Point, for example, is a fault that developed during early
Eocene time. This can be noted in the very northwest
corner of the monument, just to the west of Prow Point
(<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). Here, the Lower Member of the Wasatch Formation
on the west is faulted against the Main Body on the
east (USDI 1964). This fault also is responsible for elevating
the Thaynes Limestone so it is exposed (<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<h2 id="c30">PALEONTOLOGY</h2>
<p>Fossils of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates are
abundant in rocks exposed in the Fossil Basin. For example,
Oyster Ridge received its name because of the
well-preserved and abundant fossil oysters found there.
Of course, Fossil Butte and Fossil Butte National Monument
were so named because of the beautifully preserved
fossil fish. A brief review of the main groups of fossils to
be found in the basin follows.</p>
<h3 id="c31">Flora</h3>
<p>Many of the sediments in the Fossil Basin contain an
abundance of fossil plants. These consist of pollen,
spores, wood, and leaf impressions. Those of the Green
River Formation are best preserved and have received the
most study.</p>
<p>Brown (1929, 1934) and Lesquereux (1883) have
presented the best information on the flora of the Green
River Formation. Much of the present knowledge is based
on their work.</p>
<p>Brown (1929, 1934) concluded that the Green River
flora is a mixed forest type. It contains some plants
common to warm, wet lowlands and others adapted to
cooler, drier uplands. Pollen studies support Brown&rsquo;s
original concept that several plant communities, including
mountain communities, existed around Fossil Lake.</p>
<p>The flora was situated in an inland, mountain basin.
Fossil Lake was in the middle of the basin. Swamps and
flood plains bordered the lake, while the flanking ridges
and mountains provided altitudinal variations in the plant
assemblage.</p>
<p>Spruce, fir, and pine are indicated by fossil pollen. The
presence of these conifers suggest that at least some of the
nearby mountains rose to heights of 6000-8000 ft.</p>
<p>Leaf imprints indicate that deciduous trees occurred on
the lower slopes. Oak, elm, maple, and beech were
common forms.</p>
<p>Closer to the lake where it was wetter and warmer there
were willows, laurel, and fig trees. Palms grew in the
sandier soils (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). Cypress grew in quiet embayments
of Fossil Lake. The shoreline plant assemblage had
a rather subtropical appearance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_11">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 11. Impression of a palm frond from the fish beds of Fossil Basin.

</div>
<p>Ground cover was provided by a mold of dead leaves,
holly, liverworts, mosses, and ferns (<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>). Prairie-type
grasses are not present and large savanna areas
probably were not developed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_12">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 12. A fern leaf from the Green River Shales of the Green River

</div>
<p>In the lake itself small, one-celled algae floated about
in the waves and currents. Bacteria grew on the lake
bottom and in the water and helped to contribute to the
organic ooze that built up on the bottom. Fungi, wonderfully
preserved in oil shales, are further indicators that
Fossil Lake was a fresh-water lake and deep enough to
have depths below the zone of sunlight penetration
(Bradley 1964a). Reeds, rushes, and similar lake-shore
plants grew in shallow, near-shore waters.</p>
<p>The large amount of organic material in the rocks is
evidence of the prolific microscopic plant growth in the
lake.</p>
<p>Occasional dry periods in the Fossil Basin are
indicated by fossils of a plant called <i>Ephedra</i>. This plant
had leaves with a thick, waxy cuticle to prevent desiccation
during drought. The absence of saline minerals in the
Green River Formation in Fossil Basin suggests that these
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
arid periods were never of the intensity that occurred in
the Green River Basin to the east.</p>
<p>The flora of Fossil Basin, especially that from the
Green River Formation, is usually compared to that of the
present-day Gulf Coast. Seaward from the Appalachians,
the composition of the flora is very similar to that of the
Green River. Spruce, pine, and fir grow in the Appalachians
at elevations of 6000 or more feet, supporting the
idea that similar elevations existed near Fossil Lake and
that a general Gulf Coast climate prevailed in Fossil Basin.</p>
<h3 id="c32">Invertebrates</h3>
<p>Molluscs, ostracodes, and insects comprise the invertebrate
fauna of Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>A large number of marine forms are found in the
earlier marine deposits, while fresh-water and terrestrial
forms are common in the Tertiary units. It is these later
forms which are considered here.</p>
<p>The fresh-water and terrestrial molluscs from the
Wasatch and Green River formations include bivalves
(clams) and gastropods (snails).</p>
<p>Aquatic clams from the Green River Formation include
<i>Unio</i> and <i>Plesiellipta</i>. <i>Pisidium</i> and <i>Sphaerium</i> are
common in the Wasatch Formation.</p>
<p>Land snails from the Wasatch include such genera as
<i>Grangerella</i>, <i>Discus</i>, <i>Oreoconus</i>, and <i>Glypterpres</i>.
<i>Oreoconus</i> is also known from the Green River Formation.</p>
<p>Fresh-water snails are very abundant from both the
Wasatch and Green River formations. <i>Physa</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>,
<i>Elimia</i>, <i>Bioniphalaria</i>, <i>Virpains</i>, and <i>Omalodiscus</i> are
from the Wasatch. <i>Physa</i>, <i>Elimia</i>, <i>Diomphalaria</i>, and
<i>Goniobasis</i> are recorded from the lacustrine Green River
sediments. In some areas of the Green River Formation,
these snail fossils are so abundant that they form a major
constituent of the limestones. The presence of land snails
in the Green River and fresh-water molluscs in the
Wasatch is evidence that the two formations are not
totally representative of a single environment, but represent
several related ones.</p>
<p>Most of these fresh-water snails were herbivorous and
frequented the shallow, well-lighted areas of Fossil Lake
which had a good growth of plants and algae. This
naturally occurred close to shore, hence the gastropodal
limestones reported by Bradley (1926) and Oriel and
Tracey (1970) are interpreted as being near-shore facies.</p>
<p>Ostracodes are extremely small arthropods that produce
a two-piece, hinged shell within which they live.
<i>Pseudocypus</i> is the most common form. Like the snails,
the ostracodes were so abundant in areas that they, too,
formed a large part of some Green River Formation
limestones. And like the snails they lived in a near-shore
environment.</p>
<p>Within the laminated shales of the Green River Formation
is preserved an abundant and diverse assemblage of
fossil insects (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>
<p>These insects are important because they demonstrate
that many modern families and even genera were in
existence during the Eocene. In contrast to this, knowledge
of insect evolution prior to the Eocene is rather
poorly known. Scudder (1890) and Cockerell (1920)
have described most of the Green River insects.</p>
<p>Beetles are the most common forms, followed by
dragonflies. Maggots and larvae of flies are commonly
preserved.</p>
<p>Except for these insects preserved as whole "mummies"
in the oil shales, the majority of the insect fossils
are preserved as distilled outlines. This distillation process
resulted from the weight and heat of overlying sediments
of driving off the volatile substances from the buried
insects, leaving a hydrocarbon outline. The process is so
precise that the fine hairs and wing veins and even body-color
markings are preserved.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c33">Vertebrates</h3>
<h4 id="c34">FISH.</h4>
<p>The single factor that has made Fossil Butte
world famous is the occurrence of literally millions of
beautifully preserved fossil fish. In one layer approximately
14 inches thick, the fish are nearly black and
preserved in a nearly white shale. Most of the fish are
perfectly preserved, retaining every detail of the skeleton
and even undisturbed scales. Fish from Fossil Butte have
been collected and sold since the 1870s and may be found
on sales counters, in museums, and on living room walls
throughout the world.</p>
<p>The fossil fish from the Green River Formation have a
history of discovery stretching back to 1856. At that time
Leidy (1856:256) described a fish given to him by a Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
John Evans. Leidy called the fish <i>Clupea humilis</i>, a type
of herring. Exactly where Dr. Evans obtained the specimen
is not known. He passed through the area of the
Green River Formation several times and could have
collected it during any one of those trips (Knight 1955:12).</p>
<p>During the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad
in the 1860s, workmen blasting a cut through Green River
shales, about 2 miles west of Green River, Wyoming,
came upon remains of well-preserved fish. Hayden
(1871:742) first mentions this cut as "Petrified Fish Cut."
Many of the fish from this cut were given to Cope who
described them in Hayden&rsquo;s (1871) report. Insects, plants,
and a bird feather were also obtained from "Petrified Fish
Cut" at this time.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 1870s the first fish were obtained from
Fossil Butte itself. Cope (1877, 1878) described fish from
the Green River Formation which may be from Fossil
Butte. His locality is "nearer the mainline of Wasatch
Mountains" (Cope 1877:807). This may be Fossil Butte.
His 1878 locality information is just as poor. He does
mention a specimen of <i>Priscacara peali</i> given to him by
A. C. Peale. Since it was Peale who first wrote about
Fossil Butte, the specimen may have come from the butte.</p>
<p>Peale (1879) first mentioned the quarrying of fish at
Fossil Butte, but he had no specific date as to the discovery
of the butte or the beginning of quarrying of fish.</p>
<p>Cope (1884) published two large volumes about the
Tertiary vertebrates of the West. Here he mentioned three
fossil localities for his Green River Fish: "Petrified Fish
Cut," "The Mouth of Labarge Creek," and "Twin
Creek." Twin Creek is now known as the Fossil Butte
site.</p>
<p>Since that time, the quarries at Fossil Butte have been
extensively worked, mostly by commercial collectors.</p>
<p>The fish from Fossil Butte form an unusual array of
genera (Table 1) unlike any now found living together.
Included in the assemblage are forms usually found in
marine waters and tropical, fresh-water fish (Schaeffer
and Mangus 1965).</p>

<p>More than 40 species of fish have been described from
the Green River shales, but authorities do not agree on
how many of these are valid. Because of this, only super
specific groups will be considered in the following discussion.</p>

rare in the fish deposits of Fossil Butte. Length of original, 39 cm.

</div>
<p>One of the strangest forms to come from Fossil Butte is
that of <i>Xiphotrygon</i> (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>). This is not a true fish, but is
a sting ray, related to sharks. Closely related forms still
survive, with little change, in coastal waters in many parts
of the world. Like sharks, sting rays have a skeleton composed
of cartilage. Normally, cartilage is not preserved as
a fossil as it disintegrates readily. The excellent skeletons
of <i>Xiphotrygon</i> are good evidence of how well the shales
of the Green River Formation preserve the fossils. <i>Xiphotrygon</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
is characterized by being shortened from
back to front and flattened from top to bottom. It possesses
a long, whip-like tail and bears enormous, flat pectoral
(anterior) fins. The mouth is on the underside of the body
indicating that <i>Xiphotrygon</i>, like its modern relatives, fed
along the bottom of the lake. The strong flattened teeth
form something like a pavement in the mouth, suggesting
that it fed on clams and other hard-shelled invertebrates.
Close relatives of <i>Xiphotrygon</i> live mostly in marine
waters, but occasionally enter fresh water.</p>
<p>The paddlefish, <i>Polyodon</i>, is rare but present at Fossil
Butte. Similar forms still survive in China and the United
States. The prominent features of <i>Polyodon</i> include a
virtually scaleless body, a long, depressed snout, and long
gill rakers. The skeleton, unlike that of most modern fish,
is composed of cartilage, hence skeletons of <i>Polyodon</i> are
rare. The difference between the modern and Eocene
paddlefish are so slight that the two probably filled similar
or the same ecologic niches. This consists of feeding on
plankton and other small organisms which can be obtained
from the water. The long gill rakers would provide
a large surface area on which food could be trapped as the
water passed out through the gill slits. The large mouth
would also provide a large surface area for catching and
trapping food.</p>
<p>Quite common to streams and rivers of North America
from the Cretaceous to the Recent is the garfish, <i>Lepisosteus</i>
(<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>). The most striking feature of the gar is its
diamond-shaped scales, which are extremely hard and
shiny. The body is long, essentially of the same depth
throughout, and ending in a broad-based tail that is
slightly asymmetrical. The mouth is armed with many
small, sharp teeth for catching prey. One specimen over
5 ft long has been found in the Fossil Butte area.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_15">
<img src="images/pmg018.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="270" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 15. The fossil gar <i>Lepisosteus</i>. Only a few gar have been found at
Fossil Butte itself. Length of original, 70 cm. Across the highway from
the butte, one specimen over 5 ft long was found by Carl Ulrich.
<i>Collection of University of Wyoming.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Fossils of the bowfin <i>Amia</i> (<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) are recorded from
the Green River shales at Fossil Butte and in stream
deposits from Cretaceous to Recent. This fish is still
another &ldquo;living fossil.&rdquo; <i>Amia</i> is a nocturnal predator.
Presumably, the Eocene <i>Amia</i> had similar habits. The
body in <i>Amia</i> has become elongate, as has the dorsal fin.
The thickness of the scales has been reduced, but they are
still rather heavy and cover the body. Specimens are
rather large and deep-bodied. The tail fin is nearly symmetrical
above and below. <i>Amia</i> is rare in the Fossil Butte
fish quarries.</p>
<p>By far the most abundant fish from Fossil Butte is the
genus <i>Knightia</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a>, <a href="#fig_18">18</a>). This fish is a member of the
Clupeidae, a family that includes modern herrings, shad,
and sardines. The tail fin is small relative to the rest of the
body. A row of modified scales extends on the back from
the skull to the dorsal fin. Possibly they aided in streamlining
the fish. <i>Knightia</i> apparently fed on the large
amounts of plankton, especially algae, which lived in the
waters of Fossil Lake. Fossils of <i>Knightia</i> are also known
from Eocene lake sediments in South America.</p>
<p><i>Knightia</i> appears to have been susceptible to mass
mortalities. Some layers of shale at Fossil Butte contain
literally hundreds of thousands of these fish that must
have suffered catastrophic mass mortality. Possible
reasons for the obvious sudden death of so many fish will
be discussed in the section on paleoenvironment and
taphonomy.</p>
<p>Another Eocene relative of the herring found at Fossil
Butte is <i>Diplomystus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig_19">19</a>, <a href="#fig_20">20</a>). Like <i>Knightia</i>, <i>Diplomystus</i>
bears a row of modified scales on its back.
<i>Diplomystus</i> is the second most abundant fish at Fossil
Butte. The jaw in <i>Diplomystus</i> has a rather pronounced
oblique angle to it. The deepest portion of the body is
directly behind the gill region, with a continuous narrowing
of the body toward the tail region. <i>Diplomystus</i> is
known from Cretaceous rocks of Brazil and Syria and
from Tertiary sediments in Brazil and West Africa
(Schaeffer and Mangus 1965). Close relatives of <i>Diplomystus</i>
now inhabit the waters off the coasts of Peru and
eastern Australia.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Phareodus</i> (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>) belongs to a family of fish, the
Osteoglossidae, which began as marine forms and has
since become a fresh-water family. At present, they are
restricted to tropical rivers and lakes of South America,
Africa, and Australia. In the past they had a much greater
distribution, as its occurrence at Fossil Butte indicates,
including North America. It is a deep-bodied fish with a
large head. The anal and dorsal fins are close to the tail
fins. The many sharp teeth in the mouth attest to the
carnivorous habits of <i>Phareodus</i>.</p>
<p>The family Gonorhynchidae, the living sandfish of the
Indo-Pacific area, is represented at Fossil Butte by <i>Notogoneus</i>
(<a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>). <i>Notogoneus</i> is very long-bodied and
quite slender. The body width does not vary much from
head to tail, although narrowing does occur in the tail
region. The tail fin is symmetrical, forming a good rudder.
The anal, dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins are all small.
The body is covered with small, elongate scales. <i>Notogoneus</i>
was apparently a bottom feeder, living on small
organisms picked off or out of the bottom of Fossil Lake.</p>
<p>The Recent catfish, <i>Ameuirus</i>, has also been found at
Fossil Butte in the Green River shales. The form of the
Eocene catfish was very much like the Recent one. The
habits of the Eocene catfish were probably like those of
the modern <i>Ameuirus</i>, i.e., adaptations to a scavenger-type
existence.</p>
<p>Rather common in the sediments of Lake Gosiute,
but not yet known from the Fossil Basin, is <i>Erismatopterus</i>,
a member of the family Aphredederidae or pirate
perches. This small, elongate fish has few distinguishing
characters, the rounded front edge of the skull being most
distinguishable.</p>
<p><i>Asineops</i> is an Eocene relative of <i>Erismatopterus</i> and
also one of the pirate perches. <i>Asineops</i> is, however,
placed in a different family, the Asineopidae. <i>Asineops</i>,
like <i>Erismatopterus</i>, is a rather plain-looking fish. The
dorsal fin is long relative to the rest of the body. The body
is slightly deeper behind the gills than elsewhere, giving
<i>Asineops</i> a rather common appearance.</p>
<p>The Percidae, or perches, are represented at Fossil
Butte by <i>Mioplosus</i> (<a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>). <i>Mioplosus</i>, as indicated by
its well-developed teeth, was a carnivore that probably
preyed on its piscine relatives in Fossil Lake. The large
head blends in well with a strongly built, long body. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
anal and dorsal fins are subequal in size and positioned
opposite each other. The tail fin is large and fan-shaped.
It is easily identified by the presence of two dorsal fins.</p>

</div>
<p>The one genus for which no close living relatives can
be found is <i>Priscacara</i> (<a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>). The family Priscacaridae
is thought to be related to the bass. The family is
known only from the Eocene. The size of <i>Priscacara</i> is
extremely variable. The body is deep and nearly round
like that of the common sunfish, the head blending in well
with the body and its contours. The most distinguishing
feature of <i>Priscacara</i> is the series of strong, stout spines
supporting the anal and dorsal fins. These spines may
have acted as cut-waters for better swimming and/or they
may have protected <i>Priscacara</i> from its more voracious
relatives.</p>
<h4 id="c35">AMPHIBIANS.</h4>
<p>To date, no amphibian fossils are
known from Fossil Butte. They must have been present,
as this class of animals is recorded from Devonian rocks
more than 350 million years old and from rocks younger
than those at Fossil Butte. Living amphibians are typified
by frogs, toads, and salamanders. The lack of amphibian
remains at Fossil Butte is more likely due to nondiscovery
than nonexistence.</p>
<h4 id="c36">REPTILES.</h4>
<p>Reptile fossils are very abundant in the
Green River and Wasatch formations. Also a jaw of the
three-horned <i>Triceratops</i> is known from the Cretaceous
part of the Evanston Formation.</p>
<p>Small lizards are normally represented only by jaw
fragments and vertebrae. Their remains are most often
found by a process of washing and screening of the sediments
containing the fossils. Snakes are also represented
in the Green River Formation. Remains of these animals
are also often restricted to jaws and vertebrae. A complete
skeleton of a fossil boa, <i>Boavus idelmani</i>, has been
recovered from the Green River Formation and is the
most complete fossil snake from North America (Schaeffer
and Mangus 1965).</p>
<p>Turtles are among the most abundant reptile fossils.
They are usually found as isolated shell plates, although
many complete shells are known. The turtles <i>Trionyx</i>
(<a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), <i>Emys</i>, <i>Baena</i>, and <i>Notomorpha</i> are known
from the Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>The largest Eocene reptiles were the crocodiles
(<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>). The presence of these predaceous animals is
further evidence for a prevailing warm and humid climate
during the Eocene times since their tolerance ranges
include only comparable conditions at the present time.
A few incomplete specimens have been recovered from
near the monument.</p>
<h4 id="c37">BIRDS.</h4>
<p>Birds, which first appeared in Jurassic time,
are rare as fossils in rocks of any age because their skeletal
remains are exceedingly fragile. Their fossilization
requires special conditions because many of their bones
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
are hollow as a weight-reducing adaptation for flight.
These hollow bones are especially susceptible to breakage
and poor preservation. Scattered remains of birds,
mostly limb bones, are found in the Green River sediments.
Feather imprints have also been recovered. A
complete skeleton of <i>Gallinuloides</i>, a bird related to the
South American fowl-like chachalaca, is one of the most
significant finds from the Green River Formation. Recently,
Brodkorb (1970) described the wings of puff
birds similar to those now living in South America from
near Fossil Butte.</p>

</div>
<p>In the adjacent Green River Basin to the east, paleontologists
from the University of Wyoming have found
nesting grounds of Eocene flamingos in slightly younger
sediments of the Green River Formation. These &ldquo;rookeries&rdquo;
have yielded many hundreds of fossil bones of this
curious bird. Since these bird fossils were found proximal
to Fossil Butte, they demonstrate the near subtropical
nature of the environment in the Fossil Butte area in
Green River times.</p>
<h4 id="c38">MAMMALS.</h4>
<p>The rocks of the Evanston, Wasatch, and
Fowkes formations contain various fossilized remains of
mammals which once inhabited the Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>Mammal fossils are highly significant since they are
used extensively for correlation and dating of the Tertiary
rocks of the West. Fossils which are readily recognizable,
limited in time, and widely distributed geographically are
called &ldquo;index fossils.&rdquo; These fossils are restricted to a
particular time horizon in the rock. In this way, rocks of
unknown age which are found to contain index fossils can
be dated relatively and hence correlated with other fossil-bearing
rocks. The small condylarth <i>Haplomylus</i>
(<a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>) is a very early Eocene index fossil. Its presence
in certain sediments in the Fossil Basin shows conclusively
that these sediments were laid down in earliest
Eocene times.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_27">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 27. A jaw of the primitive mammal <i>Haplomylus</i>. Length of original,
1.3 cm. <i>Collection of University of Wyoming.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The mammal fossils found in Fossil Basin are also
important in documenting the temporal changes in evolution
and environment of the biotic community. The
picture of Eocene Wyoming drawn through interpretation
of these fossils is vastly different than that of the present
day.</p>
<p>Mammals have a long evolutionary history that began
over 200 million years ago in the Triassic period. At that
time mammals had only just evolved from their reptilian
ancestors. These earliest mammals were small, furtive
creatures. However, with the extinction of the dinosaurs
some 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous,
the mammals were able to diversify rapidly and fill the
empty ecologic niches that the dinosaurs once occupied.</p>
<p>This filling of ecologic niches voided by the dinosaurs
coupled with the spreading of mammals into hitherto
unoccupied niches resulted in the development of a large
variety of mammals. Some became extinct, others were
the ancestors of modern mammals. Fossils of mammals
found in sediments in the Fossil Basin are proof of the
extent of this Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary mammal
radiation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Early mammals bore little resemblance to their later
descendants. General trends in mammalian evolution
were increase in size and the tendency to become more
&ldquo;modern&rdquo;-looking through adaptation to changing
Tertiary environments.</p>
<p>Most mammal fossils are extremely fragmentary.
Teeth are most often preserved as they are the hardest
part of the skeleton and therefore most resistant to wear
and breakage. Thus, it often happens that the knowledge
of a particular fossil mammal is derived entirely from its
preserved dentition. This has obvious limitations for the
completeness of our understanding about mammals in
question.</p>
<p>The Paleocene portion of the Evanston Formation has
yielded mammals of Torrejonian and Tiffanian age
(<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>
<p>The Torrejonian assemblage (middle Paleocene)
(Gazin 1969) is small and poorly preserved. Its main
significance is that the fauna records a definite time interval
for the Evanston Formation. Gazin&rsquo;s work has
demonstrated this fauna to be intermediate in composition
between similarly aged faunas recovered from sites to the
north and south.</p>
<p>The major faunal elements are insectivores, primates,
condylarths (primitive ungulates), and multituberculates
(a type of extinct rodent-like mammal, with no known
descendants).</p>
<p>The poorly preserved condition of these fossils makes
discussion impossible except to note that they extend the
known time range of mammalian habitation in the Fossil
Basin.</p>
<p>The younger Tiffanian fauna (late Paleocene) (Gazin
1956) is also known from largely fragmentary remains.
The multituberculate mammal <i>Ptilodus</i>, also present in
Torrejonian deposits, is the most &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; mammal in
the fauna. The multituberculates first appeared in the
Jurassic (<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>), and are therefore the oldest lineage of
mammals that survived into Tertiary times. The molar
teeth of these animals are characterized by multiple cusps
arranged in parallel rows. <i>Ptilodus</i>, like most other
multituberculates, was specialized in that its fourth lower
premolars were expanded into shearing blades, the function
of which is not known. <i>Ptilodus</i> was in many respects
similar to rodents in the development of procumbant
incisors and in general build and appearance. Multituberculates
are, however, not related to rodents except
that both are mammals. The differentiation of rodents in
the late Paleocene and their diversification during the
Eocene probably presented strong competition for the
multituberculates who were unable to compete successfully
and so became extinct.</p>
<p>The primates were represented by <i>Plesiadapsis</i>. This
animal was about the size of a squirrel and had chisel-like
incisors. Flesh reconstructions of <i>Plesiadapsis</i>, based on
skeletal remains, show this primate to look much like a
rodent with a long-snouted skull, clawed feet, long body,
and tail. There is conceivable relationship between the
rodents and <i>Plesiadapsis</i>-like primates.</p>
<p>The dominant Tiffanian herbivorous mammals were
members of the Order Condylarthra. These primitive
ungulates were diverse in both size and appearance. It is
probable that later modern ungulates (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla)
evolved from the Condylarthra; however, there
are no surviving members of this group. The Paleocene
condylarths were mostly small animals and include such
forms as <i>Haplaletes</i>, <i>Litomylus</i>, and <i>Gidleyina</i>. These
mammals had somewhat insectivore-like teeth, and may
have bridged the gap between insectivores and archaic
hoofed mammals. One of the larger Tiffanian condylarths
was <i>Phenacodus</i>. This mammal had a long, massive skull
and a long, probably flexible body. The limbs were stout
and short. The body ended in a long tail. Small hooves
were present on all digits, which numbered five per foot.
The length of the largest <i>Phenacodus</i> was about 6 ft.</p>
<p>Carnivorous and omnivorous condylarthra were also
common. <i>Thryptacodon</i> and <i>Claenodon</i> are two types
known from the Evanston Formation in the Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>The true carnivores (Order Carnivora) were also present.
The Paleocene carnivores were small and possibly
arboreal in habit. The stem carnivore stock was represented
by the family Miacidae. In the Fossil Basin the
miacid <i>Didymictis</i> was common. In <i>Didymictis</i>, the
mouth was armed with small, sharp teeth. Most important,
the typical carnivoran carnassial (shearing) teeth had
developed. Among carnivores, from Paleocene to Recent,
the shearing blades developed on the last upper premolar
and the first lower molars. Various kinds of shearing
teeth have evolved in other mammal lineages.</p>
<p>Mammals from the Wasatch Formation in Fossil Basin
represent the Greybullian and Lysitean provincial ages
(see <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). These fossils are of earliest Eocene and
mid to early Eocene age. Fossil localities in the Wasatch
Formation of southwestern Wyoming are Knight Station
(partly Lysitean), at Elk Mountain (Greybullian), and at
Fossil Butte itself. The age of the Wasatch Formation at
Fossil Butte is Lysitean.</p>
<p>The insectivores are represented by <i>Diacodon</i>, a small
mammal known only from fragmentary material.</p>
<p>Primates also continued to expand and diversify in
Wasatchian time. <i>Microsyops</i> was a very unusual type
that belongs to the extinct family Microsyopidae. The
teeth were sharp and adapted for eating fruit and/or insects.
<i>Microsyops</i> was about the size of a rat or slightly
larger. The microsyopid primates were limited to the
Paleocene and Eocene and left no later known descendants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Another group of primates is represented by <i>Pelycodus</i>.
This was a small lemur-like animal that may possibly
have been an ancestor of higher primates (monkeys, apes,
and men). <i>Pelycodus</i>, like <i>Microsyops</i>, was an arboreal
(tree-dwelling) animal which inhabited the forests of the
Fossil Basin during the early Eocene.</p>
<p>The Order Taeniodonta is a strange and little known
group of mammals. In the sediments at Fossil Butte the
taeniodonts are represented by <i>Ectoganus</i>. This was a
moderately large animal. The skeletal adaptations were
similar to those of moles, but there was no actual relationship
between the two groups. The front feet and legs were
robust, and bore large claws. <i>Ectoganus</i> probably used
these structures to grub for food, possibly roots. The
incisor teeth were rootless and persistently growing. The
tooth enamel was restricted to two bands on either side of
the teeth. The single pair of upper and lower incisors was
greatly enlarged. The taeniodonts became extinct in the
Eocene and left no descendants.</p>
<p>Equally as strange a group of animals as the taeniodonts
are mammals in the Order Tillodonta. These were herbivorous
animals, some of which became quite large. They
have many rodent-like characters, but were not related to
rodents. In many respects, the morphology of rodents
seems to have lent itself to convergence. <i>Esthonyx</i> was the
most common tillodont from the Fossil Basin. Prominent,
rootless incisors were a characteristic of the later members
of the group. These incisors were chisel-like, as in rodents.
The molars were unusual and bore certain resemblances
to primitive carnivoran and insectivoran teeth.
The tillodonts, however, bore uncertain relationships to
other mammals and left no descendants beyond the
middle Eocene.</p>
<p>In comparison with recent faunas, Paleocene rodents
were rare faunal elements. Two early rodents were found
in the Fossil Basin Wasatch Formation:</p>
<p><i>Paramys</i> was relatively unspecialized but was diverse
in the number of species. One species of <i>Paramys</i> was
about 2 ft long and possessed a long tail. The body was
long and slender. The skull was small and rather squirrel-like.
The cheek teeth were quadrate and had low, blunt
cusps. The typical, single pair of chisel incisors was
present both on lower and upper jaws. <i>Paramys</i> was
probably an arboreal form that did not look too unlike a
modern squirrel and may have had a similar mode of life.
Another rodent, <i>Reithroparamys</i>, was somewhat similar
to <i>Paramys</i> in size and appearance. The differences between
the two animals were mainly in the teeth and hind
limbs. The latter showed certain very minor structural
modifications that suggested a saltatorial (jumping) mode
of locomotion for <i>Reithroparamys</i>.</p>
<p>Bats (Order Chiroptera) are extremely rare as fossils
because their volant and cave-dwelling habitat as well as a
fragile skeleton did not lend their remains to preservation.
From the Green River Shales, from near Fossil Butte, a
complete articulated skeleton of a bat has been found
(Jepsen 1966). This animal, named <i>Caronycteris index</i>,
was small and generalized in form. Superficially, it
looked much like a typical brown bat. This fossil is important
because it demonstrates that the bats had already
become good fliers by early Eocene time.</p>
<p>The condylarths were prominent in the early Eocene
but diminished in importance following this time.
<i>Phenacodus</i> was still extant; however, it was replaced in
importance by the smaller <i>Hyopsodus</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hyopsodus</i> is perhaps the most commonly recovered
Eocene fossil mammal. This animal was small and long-bodied
and retained a more-or-less generalized structural
pattern. In some respects <i>Hyopsodus</i> was similar to both
insectivores and primates and was at one time or another
regarded as belonging to either of these two orders.</p>
<p>Some of the later condylarths paralleled the more advanced
ungulates. Indeed, the Perissodactyla (horses,
tapirs, rhinos) and Artiodactyla (bovids, deer, pigs,
sheep, etc.) were derived from early Tertiary condylarths.
<i>Meniscotherium</i> was one such advanced condylarth. The
cusps on its molars, instead of being blunt points, had
developed into crescentic patterns, somewhat like those in
deer or camels. The relationship of <i>Meniscotherium</i> to
modern ungulates is only one of parallel dental development.
<i>Meniscotherium</i> was a medium-sized animal, but
about the same build and size as that of a cocker spaniel.
<i>Meniscotherium</i>, however, had hoofs on its toes and was a
forest-living browser.</p>
<p>The condylarth <i>Haplomylus</i> is found at the Elk Mountain
Wasatchian locality. This small animal is typical of
the Greybullian level of faunal organization (earliest
Eocene). A supposed carnivorous condylarth was <i>Pachyaena</i>.
<i>Pachyaena</i> was a fairly large animal for its time.
The strong, robust jaws and teeth and heavy build suggest
that <i>Pachyaena</i> was a predatory animal suited for preying
on larger animals such as the amphibious pantodont
<i>Coryphodon</i>. The affinities of <i>Pachyaena</i> to the condylarths
are uncertain and are based primarily on foot
structure.</p>
<p>The miacid carnivores were abundant and varied.
<i>Didymictis</i> persisted and both <i>Vassacyon</i> and <i>Vulpavus</i>
continued the arboreal, forest-dwelling habits of their
Paleocene precursors.</p>
<p>The main carnivorous animals of the Eocene, however,
were the creodonts (Order Creodonta) which were essentially
early experimenters in carnivorous habits. As such
they were diversely specialized. <i>Proviverra</i> (=<i>Sinopa</i>)
was one of the smaller, predaceous creodonts that inhabited
Fossil Basin during Eocene times.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic fossil mammals from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
early Eocene of Fossil Basin was <i>Coryphodon</i>. A specimen
of <i>Coryphodon</i> was also the first mammal fossil to be
found in the Fossil Basin. The order of mammals to which
<i>Coryphodon</i> belongs, the Pantodonta, was a group of
large and heavily built, herbivorous mammals. <i>Coryphodon</i>
was about the size of a small rhinoceros. The skull
was large and heavily built. The brain, however, was
small. The canine teeth were somewhat enlarged and
strong. Stout limbs supported the bulky body. In habits,
<i>Coryphodon</i> was possibly semi-aquatic.</p>
<p>The modern ungulates, Order Perissodactyla (odd-toed
ungulates) and Order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates),
first appeared in the early Eocene. The earliest members
of both orders were small and relatively unspecialized.</p>
<p>The earliest perissodactyls were the horses and tapirs.
The earliest horses were represented by <i>Hyracotherium</i>.
This small, slender, and lightly built horse was about the
size of a fox terrier. The front feet had four toes, and the
hind feet three toes. The teeth suggest that this animal was
probably a browser, living in the forests. In the Fossil
Basin, tapirs were known from deposits of Lysitean (mid
to early Eocene) age of which <i>Heptodon</i> was representative.
The tapirs now live in the tropics of Malaysia and
Latin America. Their present habitat suggests a similar
environment may have been favored by the Eocene tapirs
of the Fossil Basin.</p>
<p>The first Artiodactyls were pig-like forms, although
they are only distantly related to true suids. <i>Protodichobune</i>
was small and may have looked much like some of
the early Perissodactyls. There are, however, a complex
of structural features which serve to distinguish these
mammalian orders from each other.</p>
<p>The mammal fauna from the Fowkes Formation places
a late Bridgerian age on the Sillem and Bulldog Hollow
members (Nelson 1973). Small mammals were most
abundant in the Fowkes, especially primates and rodents.
The marsupials were characterized by <i>Peratherium</i> which
was a small, probably arboreal, opossum-like animal.
<i>Peratherium</i> was but one stage in a slow and relatively
conservative evolution of opossums that began in the
Cretaceous.</p>
<p>The condylarths decreased in importance during
Fowkes time and were gradually replaced by more advanced
ungulates, the artiodactyls and perissodactyls.
Only the small <i>Hyopsodus</i> survived into the Bridgerian of
the Fossil Basin. The horses continued to differentiate as
evidenced by the appearance of <i>Orohippus</i>, an animal
similar to <i>Hyracotherium</i>, but with minor dental differences.
The primitive tapirs were represented by <i>Hyrachyus</i>,
a medium-sized herbivore which was nearly as
closely related to the rhinoceroses as it was to the tapirs.</p>
<p>The primates were also diverse in Fowkes time; however,
this group began to decline in importance following
Bridgerian times. As a group, the primates were restricted
mainly to warm and forested environments. The lemur-like
<i>Notharctus</i> and the tarsier-like <i>Omomys</i> and <i>Hemiacodon</i>
were common in the Fowkes. <i>Hemiacodon</i> was
typical of the late Bridgerian (an index fossil).</p>
<p>The true carnivores, represented by <i>Miacis</i>, remained
small in size, perhaps to avoid competition with the larger
surviving creodonts.</p>
<p>Insectivores from the Fowkes Formation are abundant
and varied. Unfortunately, they are known almost exclusively
from teeth. Fowkes insectivores include the
hedge-hog-like <i>Nyctitherium</i>, <i>Talpavus</i>, and <i>Scenopagus</i>.
<i>Apatemys</i> is an insectivore of uncertain affinities. The
feeding habits of these early insectivores were probably
similar to those of contemporary insectivore species
(moles and shrews); however, there is some evidence to
suggest many of these small creatures may have been
semi-arboreal.</p>
<p>One of the most unusual of middle Eocene creatures is
the giant <i>Uintatherium</i>. This was a large browsing animal,
about the size of a rhinoceros. What was most unusual
about <i>Uintatherium</i> was its skull which was large and
strongly built. The large upper canines were apparently
formidable defensive weapons. The skulls of the males
bore six prominent bony protuberances which grew from
the frontal region of the skull. The function of these structures
is unknown. They may have been of use for defense.</p>
<p>During Bridgerian times, the rodents underwent an
explosive adaptive radiation which ultimately may have
led to the near extinction of the less well-adapted multituberculates.
The diversity of Bridgerian rodents from
Fossil Basin is impressive. Species of <i>Leptotomus</i>,
<i>Paramys</i>, <i>Thisbemys</i>, <i>Microparamys</i>, <i>Sciuravus</i>, <i>Mysops</i>,
and <i>Pauromys</i> demonstrate that a wide range of adaptations
of environments was exploited by the rodents. This
diversity in life habits has been a mark of rodent evolution
from the middle Eocene to the present day.</p>
<p>The above descriptions of the known mammal fossils
from the Fossil Butte area are intended to demonstrate
the varied life forms that once existed in southwestern
Wyoming. Further collecting will almost certainly expand
the number of fossil mammal species from Fossil
Basin and increase our knowledge of the succession of
ancient environments which prevailed at different times
in the Fossil Basin area.</p>

<h2 id="c39">PALEOECOLOGY AND TAPHONOMY</h2>
<p>Paleoecology is the study of ancient biotic communities
and their relationship to the abiotic environment. The
conclusions of paleoecology are reached by studying in
detail the fossils and sediments and whatever relationships
exist between them. Its ultimate aim is to build a
picture of the climate, flora, fauna, and topographic
setting of an area. For this reason it borrows heavily from
paleontology, paleobotany, sedimentology, and climatology.</p>
<p>From studying modern environments, it is observed
that each has its own type of sediment. When certain
sediments are found in the rock record, it is generally
assumed that they represent environments similar to
modern ones that produce similar deposits. For example,
limestone is forming today in warm, shallow, well-lighted,
well-aerated water. When limestone is found in a
rock sequence, it is usually assumed that the same or
similar environmental conditions occurred in that area in
the past. Fossils can further refine the interpretation.</p>
<p>As can be interpreted from foregoing discussions, the
sediments deposited in the Fossil Basin vary from stream
and flood-plain fluvial to lacustrine. At times, material
eroded from surrounding uplands was carried by streams
throughout the basin. These rocks are exemplified by the
Evanston and parts of the Wasatch and Fowkes formations.
When the lake appeared, lacustrine sediments,
marlstone, and shale were deposited in the lake, while
around the periphery of the basin, fluvial sediments continued
to accumulate.</p>
<p>Plants found in the lake sediments of Fossil Basin tell
us much about the climatic conditions that prevailed
during the Eocene. The flora is quite similar to that now
existing in the southeastern United States, reflecting a
warm and humid climate. One of the striking examples is
that of huge palm fronds that occasionally are found in the
fish quarries at Fossil Butte. These seem to be fronds that
blew from the trees into the lake. Soon they became
water-logged and settled to the bottom to be preserved.</p>
<p>The land animals indicate that a rather wide range of
ecologic niches existed over the basin before the lake
came into being, around the lake during its presence, and
again all over the basin after the lake disappeared. Many
of the smaller mammals, some of the rodents, and most of
the primates were almost certainly arboreal. The large
mammals such as uintatheres, pantodonts, and tapiroids
may have been stream-side or marsh dwellers. Probably
inhabiting the forest floor and feeding on low bushes and
undergrowth were such forms as the condylarths, horses,
artiodactyls, and some of the rodents. Feeding on the
rodents and other smaller mammals were the creodonts
and miacids. Tiny shrew-like forms scampered about the
undergrowth and fed upon worms and insects.</p>
<p>Bradley (1963) has estimated possible temperature and
precipitation levels in southwestern Wyoming during the
Eocene. Bradley&rsquo;s modern analogues were the Gulf Coast
and Great Lakes regions. From a series of calculations, an
average annual temperature of 65&deg;F is postulated. This
could have fluctuated greatly in the inland setting of Fossil
Basin. Precipitation amounts were possibly on the order
of 30-43 inches annually. The amount of annual evaporation
was also possibly in the range of 30-43 inches.</p>
<p>It is believed that Fossil Lake was thermally stratified&mdash;that
is, with colder, denser water at depth (hypolimnion)
and warmer, less dense water (epilimnion) nearer the
surface. The deeper waters probably would have been
devoid of oxygen, hence essentially uninhabited other
than by anaerobic bacteria that survive without oxygen. If
the bottom had been oxygenated, many types of life
would have burrowed into the sediment thus destroying
the delicate varves (<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>). The lake was probably
deep enough that wind and wave action did not roil the
bottom sediments.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_28">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 28. A section of shales from the fish beds showing thin laminae that
are interpreted as varves. Enlarged six times.</p>
</div>
<p>There have been many attempts to interpret the taphonomy
(see glossary) of concentrations of fish at Fossil
Butte. Bradley (1948) interpreted the cause of death and
the reason for their preservation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this basin (Fossil, Wyo.) hundreds of thousands of
beautifully preserved fish are entombed in the varved
sediments. Even the delicate fin and tail rays and other
bones originally held in place only by tissue are virtually
undisturbed, and even the scales are in place almost
completely undisturbed. It seems to me that the picture of
this lake as a thermally stratified water body provides
nearly all the necessary information to account for the
excellent preservation of these fish. Only in the stagnant
hypolimnion could they have escaped being torn to pieces
by scavengers or distorted by bottom feeders. It is significant
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
that all the well preserved fish are in varved sediments.
Those in non-varved sediments are a disordered mass of
broken and chewed up bones.</p>
<p>The only part of the story lacking now is how the fish
died and got into the hypolimnion. Limnology offers two
possible explanations. Sometimes when the surface of a
lake gets excessively warm, fish will plunge into deep
water and might thus penetrate the hypolimnion, be overcome
by hydrogen sulphide, and also have the gas in their
swim bladders chilled so that they sank at once to the
bottom. Once there, only anaerobic bacteria would attack
them. The other hypothesis is that the thermally stratified
lake was suddenly chilled so that it overturned more rapidly
than the hydrogen sulphide could be oxydized and so killed
off large numbers of fish. This seems a little more probable
as the fossil fish are of all ages and sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fish in these quarries have been collected since the
1870s but mainly by commercial collectors. Most
museum collections were purchased from these commercial
collectors, hence they consist almost entirely of perfectly
preserved fish, as poorly preserved specimens
would be discarded by the collectors as of no monetary
value. The result has been that most people, including
Bradley, were misled into believing all of the fish in the
varved sediments of the quarry were perfectly preserved.
As nearly as can be determined, the first attempt to systematically
collect and study this concentration of fish
was that by paleontologists from the University of Wyoming
(McGrew 1974). This work threw much new light
on the occurrence and made available much new data that
permit new interpretations.</p>
<p>Shales of the Green River Formation in general have
been described by Bradley (1931) and he specifically
mentioned those of the fish layer in the Fossil
Basin as follows: &ldquo;Plate 1 shows a thin section of the
varved marlstone in the small, unnamed Green River
Lake west of Gosiute Lake, where the varves are better
developed. Each varve or annual deposit, consists of a
layer of microgranular carbonates and a thinner, dark
layer of organic matter&rdquo; (Bradley 1948:645). The X-ray
diffraction analyses performed by John Ward Smith of the
Laramie Energy Research Center showed that the shales
of the &ldquo;fish layer&rdquo; consist predominantly of calcite
(roughly 60%), aragonite and dolomite (approximately
20%), and quartz (up to 10%).</p>
<p>Although fish are numerous throughout the thickness of
this &ldquo;fish layer,&rdquo; there are three laminae that contain so
many fish that it is almost certain that they represent
catastrophic mass mortalities. Two are made up primarily
of <i>Priscacara</i> and one consists almost exclusively of
<i>Knightia</i>.</p>
<p>X-ray photos show that a rather high percentage of
the fish in the shales are not perfectly preserved but
have undergone varying amounts of disarticulation. There
appears to be an orderly sequence of stages of decomposition&mdash;from
essentially perfect articulation to total
disarticulation. Disarticulation first appears in the most
anterior vertebrae. From there it rapidly proceeds anteriorly
into the head region and appears to do so posteriorly
at a slower rate. In many specimens the head and
anterior half of the body are completely disarticulated,
while the posterior part of the body shows no disarticulation
whatever.</p>
<p>It is assumed that after the dead fish settled to
the bottom of the lake, external anaerobic bacteria found
access to the &ldquo;innards&rdquo; of the fish via the opercular
opening. This would account for the first sign of decomposition
and disarticulation being just back of the head.</p>
<p>In the blocks of shale covered by X-ray there were
385 fish. For convenience, these were classified into six
groups, group I showing no discernable disarticulation
and group VI (<a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a>) showing total disarticulation. The
number and percentage of fish in each group are as follows:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Group I </td><td class="r">223 fish </td><td class="r">58%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Group II </td><td class="r">38 fish </td><td class="r">10%</td></tr>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 29. A partially disarticulated skeleton of a large <i>Priscacara</i>, Group IV.</p>
</div>
<p>Because of the predominance of completely articulated
fish throughout the quarry and the fact that the fish involved
in the mass mortalities show no disarticulation, it
seems probable that some connection might exist between
the death of the fish and conditions of the lake bottom that
would cause their perfect preservation. It would seem that
rapid burial might be the most obvious reason for excellent
preservation. Thus any factor or combination of
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
factors that would cause rapid precipitation of carbonates
and also would cause mortality of fish would satisfy our
requirements. One obvious factor that could, at least
theoretically, fulfill these requirements would be an
annual bloom of blue-green algae that are known to be
toxic to fish (Prescott 1948). Such blooms usually occur
during the warmest part of the summer when CaCO&#8323; is
least soluble. By extracting CO&#8322; from the water, these
algae are known to cause precipitation of CaCO&#8323;. Thus
we have a possible cause for some annual fish kill and
perhaps an occasional superbloom that would bring about
a catastrophic mass mortality. The highest mortality of
fish then might have occurred during late summer algal
blooms and at this time also would occur the most rapid
precipitation of CaCO&#8323;.</p>
<p>It is not known how much deposition of CaCO&#8323; would
be required to protect a fish from disarticulation. It may
be that a very thin layer, especially if mixed with organic
ooze, might provide an effective seal to slow decomposition
and prevent disarticulation. If sufficient CaCO&#8323; was
precipitated and deposited to cover the fish that died
during this period, one might expect perfect preservation.
Such fish would fit into group I. Those fish that died just
after this period might lie exposed on the lake bottom for
most of a year and be subject to disarticulation. If little or
no deposition took place during the rest of the year, fish
that died just after the period of deposition should be the
most completely disarticulated and fit into group VI.
During the fall, winter, and spring, fish that died of attritional
mortality would be disarticulated according to the
length of time they lay on the bottom prior to the next
period of deposition.</p>
<p>If the foregoing is true, one should be able to determine
the approximate time of year fish died by the degree of
disarticulation. One might assume that blooms of blue-green
algae and hence precipitation of CaCO&#8323; would take
place sometime during August and/or September. Thus
we should expect the most fish and those most perfectly
preserved to have died during this time period (group I).
Those fish that died in October and/or November should
be the most completely disarticulated (group VI), and
those that died in June or July should show only a slight
degree of disarticulation (group II). The distribution of the
stages of disarticulation seems to fit almost exactly the
pattern that one would expect if this interpretation is
correct.</p>
<p>Gunter (1947) has shown that annual periods of excess
salinity in Texas lagoons cause an annual increase in the
death of fish and occasionally a catastrophic mass mortality.
Because Lake Gosiute is known to have been saline, it
might be assumed that somewhat similar chemical conditions
prevailed in the Fossil Lake. It is not known definitely
that the two lakes were ever connected but if they
were, it was most probably a narrow connection near the
southern end of Fossil Lake and probably a rather temporary
connection.</p>
<p>That a rather long period of aridity occurred in the
general region is demonstrated by various depositional
features, primary structures, and salt deposition in
Gosiute Lake in a part of the Green River Formation.
These deposits appear to have settled down during Lostcabinian
(late to early Eocene) times. Because the
Wasatch Formation immediately underlying the Fossil
Butte Member of the Green River Formation in the Fossil
Syncline Basin is Lysitean (mid to early Eocene), it is
probable that the fish deposits are of Lostcabinian age.
Thus it may well be that the long period of aridity occurred
during the deposition of the fish beds. While the Fossil
Lake probably never reached the high degree of salinity
present in Lake Gosiute, it was probably sufficiently
saline that periods of excessive evaporation could increase
the salinity enough to contribute to the mortality of fish
and occasionally cause a catastrophic mass mortality such
as those described by Gunter. The presence of aragonite
and dolomite in the shales suggests that at least some of
the carbonate deposition might well have been because of
excessive evaporation and high concentrations of carbonates
(Smith 1974, pers. comm.).</p>
<p>At the University of Wyoming, an attempt is being
made to interpret scales of fish from the quarries. In a
number of specimens annuli can be observed and circuli
counted. Although removal of scales for study is extremely
difficult, a number has been removed and photographed
with a scanning electron microscope. In Lake
George, Florida, black crappie develop annuli during
January, February, March, and April (Huish 1954).
Climatic conditions in north central Florida may be
similar to those that existed in western Wyoming during
the early Eocene. Thus annuli may have developed at the
same time of year. By counting the number of circuli between
the last annulus and the edge of the scale, it should
be possible to determine the approximate time of death of
a fossil fish. If this should correlate with the degree of
disarticulation, a check on this interpretation should be
possible. Sufficient data are not yet available, however,
for the results to be conclusive.</p>
<p>It is not intended to suggest that the conditions outlined
above could account for all of the fish concentrations in
the Green River Shales. In certain shales in the Green
River Basin, for example, the concentrations of <i>Knightia</i>
in nonvarved shales appear to have been deposited in
quite shallow water. These fish are extremely well preserved
but were obviously laid down under conditions
quite different from those at Fossil Butte. Much study of
these occurrences will be necessary before interpretations
are possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The story, as told here, should make it clear that the
earth is ever-changing. What was once a beautiful, deep
lake in an area of lush tropical forests is now a dry, sagebrush
desert. What was once an area in which sediments
were accumulating is now an area of erosion, occasioned
by a broad uplift of the region near the end of Tertiary
time.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this brief story of the geologic history
of Fossil Butte National Monument will give the reader
some appreciation of the geologic complexity not only of
the monument itself but of the surrounding area as well.
Certainly such knowledge will add to the enjoyment of a
visit to the monument.</p>
<p>It may seem that geologists have all of the answers.
This, however, is not so. Interpretations are made on the
basis of available evidence. Each time a geologist studies
an area more geologic data and more evidence become
available and our interpretations become a little more
accurate. It will be many years before all details of this
fascinating history will be known.</p>

<h2 id="c43">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p>This report, which was prepared under National Park Service Contract CX 6000-3-0076,
leans heavily on the publications of those many people who have studied various geologic
aspects of the Fossil Basin. We would like to cite particularly Doctors Steven Oriel and
Joshua Tracy of the United States Geological Survey, whose studies have clarified the
stratigraphic relationships of the sediments involved. Dr. D. L. Blackstone, Jr., of the
University of Wyoming supplied information from his yet unpublished interpretations of
the complicated structure of the Idaho-Wyoming thrust belt. Mr. Tom Bown helped with
the structural part of the report and critically reviewed other parts. The drafting, except for
Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#fig_9">9</a>, was done by Mr. Evan Groutage. Mrs. Elaine Hertzfeldt, secretary for the
Department of Geology, aided greatly in preparing this manuscript.</p>
